Details:

A simple Contacts application that supports following two operations:
Add contact
Search Contact

A Contact is defined as firstName and/or lastName separated by space. Like:

Chris Harris
Chris Cairns
Harry Potter
Chris

Add contact takes the name and adds it to contact list.
Search contact matches the contacts for a given search string.
Search results are ranked, exact matches are listed first. Other matches are listed alphabetically. Search can be done by last name too.


3 different implementations of the Contact List class, each better in performance than the previous. Current final version is V2.
